    # == Optional parameters are:
    # * <tt>:query</tt> -- The query parameter can be any search criteria you can use in the interface. A common use would be to use this function to get all of a memberâ€™s details by sending the email address as the query.
    # * <tt>:raw</tt> -- if you want to return all users, regardless of suppression status, add the raw=true parameter on the end of your query.
    # * <tt>:add_list</tt> -- You can add the results of the search to a new or existing list by passing an additional add_list parameter with the name of the list.

    #
    # This will add an existing member to a list or create a new audience member with that
    # email address and add that member to the list. Any additional parameters passed (such as
    # first_name and last_name) will be +added+ or +updated+ on the audience member.

    # Remove Audience List Membership
    #
    # Removes an existing email address from an audience list. The member is not deleted
    # and will remain on any other lists. The email address is simply removed from that
    # audience list.

    # list do not count towards your total active audience.
